# psdiff
**http://filp.github.io/psdiff**

*psdiff* uses git hooks and the lovely [psd.rb](https://github.com/layervault/psd.rb)
library to automagically generate up-to-date image files from PSDs in the repository,
allowing you to easily preview them and make use of github's image diff tools.

```bash

## master
A  mock.psd

filp@filp-x ~/dev/myproject
> $ git commit -m "Add mock.psd"

psdiff: created mock.psd.png # <----------

That's it!

## How do I install this?

Glad you asked! Couldn't be easier. Just run this in the root of a git repo:

```
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.github.com/filp/psdiff/master/install.sh)
```

Here's what that script does:

 1. Scolds you if you don't have Ruby installed (it's required!)
 2. Checks if the `psd` gem is installed and allows you to install it if needed.
 3. Downloads the `pre-commit` hook from this repo to your `.git/hooks`.

Congrats! Any changes you make to psd files in the repository will now trigger psdiff!

### Warning

It's **not really** a good idea to keep large PSD files in your repositories - this project
is partially a proof-of-concept, and partially a helper for existing projects.
